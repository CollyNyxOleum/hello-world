# hello-world
This is the first repository I am creating while learning how to use GitHub.
I am about to be 30 and I want to become a great software engineer. Then teach others what I have learned later in life.
I have deleted the previous words here and see what happens when I recommit a branch. 


I am using the git command line to type this up and commit the new changes.
